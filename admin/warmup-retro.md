# Warmup Team Analysis: 

## Overview
**Review Date:** [10/19/2024] 
**Reviewer:** Team 4 (Pineapple Pipeline) 

## Summary of Warmup Assignment Distributions
Since the Warmup task was broken up into 3 major parts, our team decided to split the work and assign 2 members to bigfoot.js, 2 members to littlefoot.js, and 5 members to tinyfoot.js. Tasks are then further broken down within each subgroup. Our belief was that should any subgroup from the first two parts finish first, they will join the tinyfoot.js subgroup to assist where needed. 

## Bigfoot.js Subgroup

### Things that Went Well
In the Bigfoot subgroup, we prioritized itemizing and splitting the tasks iteratively. One member had extensive JS experience, while the other did not have much JS experience, which paired perfectly in a learning fashion. Meeting time was planned out to spend time going through the codebase, marking points of interest. Once this was complete, each member attempted to design a new feature and merge them into the pre-existing Bigfoot codebase. The code review was done collaboratively but on each others time, sharing notes on what to talk about.

### Things that Need Improvement
More emphasis on collaborative coding. Other than reviewing and iteratively going through the code base, the coding tasks were done separately so there was not much learning in terms of collaboration involved. In addition, it might have been a good idea to invite other members of team 4 to review, and learn from our design decisions for Bigfoot, so that the whole team has the opportunity to see the horrors of CoffeeScript.

### Notes for Future Meetings
- Plan out initial steps when assignment/task is released.
- Emphasize researching and looking up documentation for obscure languages.


## Littlefoot.js Subgroup

### Things that Went Well
The Littlefoot.js subgroup had a wide variety of differences across experience levels with web development and TypeScript among the two members of the team but decided to have each member focus on their strengths. We further divided the roles so that one member was in charge of making the changes and putting down thoughts as bullet points, and the other member focused on the code review write-up. This division meant that there were limited overlaps between the tasks and therefore each member could complete the tasks fairly easily.

### Things that Need Improvement
The overall subgroup division impacted the Littlefoot.js subgroup. Since the Tinyfoot.js subteam quickly started building on top of Littlefoot.js, they provided new insights for the code review. Therefore, it would have made more sense if there was more collaboration between the subteams instead of an initial division that assumed no overlap between each subteam. Luckily, all subteams stayed open in communications and extended support to each other, ensuring that subteam progress was aligned.

### Notes for Future Meetings
* Think systematically and think carefully about team divisions, even though it sounds tempting. We have to put careful consideration into whether tasks overlap or depend on each other
* Transparency across different tasks is crucial

## Tinyfoot.js Subgroup

### Things that Need Improvement
When starting this assignment, the Tinyfoot.js subgroup decided to fork littlefoot.js and build on top of that. One of our major pitfalls was that our subgroup did not sit down in that first meeting to fully go through the bigfoot.js and littlefoot.js repos to determine whether or not it was better to fork or start from scratch. Because of how we decided to split up the warmup assignment, tinyfoot.js went in blind with what the state of bigfoot.js and littlefoot.js was truly like. This led many members to become confused in their tasks and made it difficult to complete.

We ended up realizing after a few days and many hours devoted individually that littlefoot was more trouble than it was worth to build on top of. This realization came when we became aware that the best way for us to make littlefoot better was to remove a plethora of packages and functionalities from it. This idea is what eventually led us to pivot plans to a from-scratch approach.

Additionally, we were not specific enough in what functionalities each member was developing and how they would interplay, which resulted in many of our works clashing on merge. So instead of pushing for a concise product as a team, we tried to implement all the ideas we thought were good independent of one another.

### Things that Went Well
Although we had a rocky start, our team was able to pull through these mistakes and properly execute our tinyfoot.js assignment. Shoutout to Jake and Adrian for being the first members to notice the littlefoot.js mistakes and notifying the rest of the team, and shoutout to Tim for having the resolve to suggest starting from scratch so late in the process. Also grateful to all members of the team for working hard despite our initial setback to ensure our success on the assignment.

Learning from mistakes, the tinyfoot.js team was able to reevaluate our the situation and execute a pivot to a new strategy. This time, we properly detailed and distributed tasks. We were honest and pragmatic about the timeframe and abilities available to us, and came up with a plan with surplus time and manpower should we need it. Communication from this point onwards was concise and clear. We saw few wasted man hours as the interconnection between tasks and roles was much more clearly defined.

### Notes for Future Meetings
* From the first major meeting, ensure to go over the whole assignment together along with the corresponding repositories or notable code related to the assignment
* Be detailed in what tasks need to be done and ensure that there is a separation of concerns within assigned tasks
* All team members need to know what their specific role is and how it interplays with all other roles in the team. If we have no knowledge of how our work will make the work of others easier or harder, the team will move at a snail's pace
* View the project from a perspective of constraints rather than potential
* Proper and consistent communication is key

## Conclusion
Although some subgroups had a rocky start, we were able to learn from our mistakes and improve on our next iteration. Proud of us, Pineapple Pipeline!
